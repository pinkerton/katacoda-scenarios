The first thing we'll do is set up the Serverless Framework in our environment, following the steps from [their docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/).

Install the Serverless framework with NPM: `npm install -g serverless`.

You should now be able to `serverless -v`.

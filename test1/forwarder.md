Follow these [steps](docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_web_services/?tab=allpermissions#log-collectionp) to set up the Datadog Forwarder Lambda function. Which forwards custom metrics and logs from Lambda functions to Datadog.

NOTE: You do NOT need to do this, as we are sharing one AWS and Datadog account in this workshop.

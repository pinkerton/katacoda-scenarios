The first thing we'll do is set up the Serverless Framework in our environment, following the steps from [their docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/).

1. node.js should be automatically installed in your KataCoda environment when you open this tutorial. Confirm using `node -v`.
2. Install the Serverless framework with NPM: `npm install -g serverless`

You should now be able to `serverless -v`.
